  "title": "Project Gary Tulip: Fashion brand in creation of Badem Media",

  "section1": {
    "title": "The Summary",
    "desc": "We are proud of this story because we got the Gary Tulip brand when this recognizable tulip was “just a seed”. We’d had the name and - nothing more! <br/> <br/> We’ve created this brand “from zero” and that’s why we consider it somewhat ours and dear. <br/> <br/> When something that had just been an idea grew up into an established brand which people recognize and, even more important, consume, our pride and personal satisfaction were through the roof!",

      {
        "title": "The Challenge",
        "text": "The challenge lay in conveying the vision to all channels and in every kind of expression - from social media, over the visual identity, tons of target group addressing and many ways to present the product. <br/> <br/> When you’re starting from the ground, possibilities are infinite, but so are the challenges."
      },
      {
        "title": "The Solution",
        "text": "Our branding process will easily let you know what our moto is - “we have something in common”.  <br/> <br/> The goal is to understand the person behind the brand through the human approach and to find out what his vision is, what do the target group and he have in common.  <br/> <br/> When we get those two things along - the inner part which comes from the brand’s creator and the outer part which comes from the target group - everything else becomes easy!"
      },
      {
        "title": "The Results",
        "text": "The result was the brand that had became the dream come true to its creator and everything that he’d imagined implemented into reality and the story which attracts the audience and with which the target group - men that are 25-55 - identifies.  <br/> <br/> One more brand created.  <br/> One more dream achieved."

  "section2": {
    "title": "Visuals",
    "desc": "The visuals that we’ve created for Gary Tulip communicate self-confidence and inviolability towards men tend to go. <br/> <br/> Through the colors, fonts and thematic approach to each and every photo session, we’ve created one old-school atmosphere... <br/> <br/> ...because authentic masculine fashion never gets old.",
    "content": {
      "title": "Feed",
      "text1": "Feed was created the way that it always gives you a feeling as if you were reading a magazine that attracts men, such as Men’s Health, Top Gear, Men’s World or GQ.",
      "text2": "Main mission was to make identity and feed easy to digest, because the target group is not only attracted by authenticity, but the subtlety as well. To stay expressive, but subtle at the same time is the challenge on its own.",

  "section3": {
    "title": "Results",
    "desc": "In the first month, before the shop was even created on the site, Gary Tulip had already sold double digits merch via Instagram DM. <br/> <br/> Because when you awaken people’s desire for your products, they don’t care if there is a site or if the shop had been created. <br/> <br/> They will find a way to get to the products which they are obsessed with!"

  "section4": {
    "title": "Impressions",
    "desc": "Gary Tulip is a fashion brand that, at its start, had to rely on digital technologies for us to reach customers and sell our pieces. The Badem Media team was our sincere partner in this endeavor, as they not only put us in front of the target audience but also crafted the image that this target group would see. <br/> <br/> We owe the brand concept of Gary Tulip to them because they helped us create a brand that communicates, leaves an impression, comes to life, and of course... sells!"
